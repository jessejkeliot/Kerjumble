# Portfolio

This Svelte project contains many projects of mine such as:

* **Kerjumble** - A simple definition guessing game in the style of a dictionary entry
* **Palette Gradient Mapper** - A utility application for applying gradient maps to images, and extracting palettes
* **Quick Define** - Univsersity assignment demo app that utilises the [FreeDictionaryAPI](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)
* **World Finder** - Demo app of the [RestCountries API](https://restcountries.com/)
* **Shader a Day** - An upcoming project where I make a shader for every day of the year

# Showcase

1. ## Kerjumble

Kerjumble is a daily game that tests your vocabulary and semantic skills. You are given a definition with its words shuffled and you must guess within five attempts, what the word being defined is. However, with each incorrect guess, the definition becomes less garbled.

2. ## Palette Gradient Mapper

The Palette Gradient Mapper is a dual-purpose utility that allows you to extract dominant colours from images, but also then to apply those colours to images through the process of a gradient map. There are various options for what medium through which you would like to apply the gradient: brightness(most common), hue, saturation,
